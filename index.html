            <p>
              PC gaming is the ultimate experience when playing video games.
              With the right hardware, you can play games with the best graphics
              and performance. PC gaming is also more affordable in the long run
              because you can upgrade your hardware instead of buying a new
              console. You can also play games with a keyboard and mouse, which
              is more precise than a controller. You can also switch bewteen
              controller and keyboard and mouse depending on the game you are
              playing. PC gaming is the best way to play video games.
